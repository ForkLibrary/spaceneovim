## Installation

Spacevim provides 2 ways of using it. First you can use it as a vim distribution like Spacemacs.
Or you can only install it as a set of key bindings and Spacevim will bring out the best of your currently installed plugin.

### Distribution mode

You want a full vim distribution like Spacemacs provides for emacs.
Execute this line of shell, it will download a default `.vimrc` and install
plugins through vim.

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctjhoa/spacevim/master/vimrc.sample -o ~/.vimrc | vim
```

After plugins installation restart vim.

### Manual

You already have a vim config and/or want to manage your plugins yourself.
This mode will provide only Spacemacs key bindings and adapt spacevim with currently installed plugins.
Install Spacevim as usual:
